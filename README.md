  - `agents/gsd-codebase-mapper.md` - Explores codebase and writes structured analysis documents. Spawned by map-codebase with a focus area (tech, arch, quality, concerns). Writes documents directly to reduce orchestrator context load.
  - `agents/gsd-debugger.md` - Investigates bugs using scientific method, manages debug sessions, handles checkpoints. Spawned by /gsd-debug orchestrator.
  - `agents/gsd-executor.md` - Executes GSD plans with atomic commits, deviation handling, checkpoint protocols, and state management. Spawned by execute-phase orchestrator or execute-plan command.
  - `agents/gsd-integration-checker.md` - Verifies cross-phase integration and E2E flows. Checks that phases connect properly and user workflows complete end-to-end.
  - `agents/gsd-phase-researcher.md` - Researches how to implement a phase before planning. Produces RESEARCH.md consumed by gsd-planner. Spawned by /gsd-plan-phase orchestrator.
  - `agents/gsd-plan-checker.md` - Verifies plans will achieve phase goal before execution. Goal-backward analysis of plan quality. Spawned by /gsd-plan-phase orchestrator.
  - `agents/gsd-planner.md` - Creates executable phase plans with task breakdown, dependency analysis, and goal-backward verification. Spawned by /gsd-plan-phase orchestrator.
  - `agents/gsd-project-researcher.md` - Researches domain ecosystem before roadmap creation. Produces files in .planning/research/ consumed during roadmap creation. Spawned by /gsd-new-project or /gsd-new-milestone orchestrators.
  - `agents/gsd-research-synthesizer.md` - Synthesizes research outputs from parallel researcher agents into SUMMARY.md. Spawned by /gsd-new-project after 4 researcher agents complete.
  - `agents/gsd-roadmapper.md` - Creates project roadmaps with phase breakdown, requirement mapping, success criteria derivation, and coverage validation. Spawned by /gsd-new-project orchestrator.
  - `agents/gsd-verifier.md` - Verifies phase goal achievement through goal-backward analysis. Checks codebase delivers what phase promised, not just that tasks completed. Creates VERIFICATION.md report.
  - `agents/microck-researcher.md` - An autonomous deep-research agent that recursively explores topics, manages its own planning files, and runs for extended periods to gather exhaustive information.
  - `agents/web-search-modules/academic-papers.md` - Academic Papers definition.

  - `agents/web-search-modules/stackoverflow.md` - Stackoverflow definition.
  - `agents/web-search.md` - Use this agent when you need to research information on the internet, particularly for debugging issues, finding solutions to technical problems, or gathering comprehensive information from multiple sources. This agent e
