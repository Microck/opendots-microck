description: Generate strong names for developer tools using structured naming patterns.
---

I will provide the context for a project (code, README, or description).

**Process:**
1.  **Analyze:** Identify the core functionality, target audience, and the technical "vibe" (e.g., minimalist, heavy-duty, fast, secure).
2.  **Generate:** Create a list of names based on the following specific stylistic patterns.

**The Naming Patterns:**

### 1. The Portmanteau (3 Options)
Blend two relevant technical words into a seamless new term (e.g., *Termcast* = Terminal + Broadcast).

### 2. The Polyglot (1 Option per language)
Choose a single, evocative word that metaphorically describes the tool in the following languages. *Provide the English translation for each.*
*   **Italian:** (Style: Elegant, structural)
*   **Latin:** (Style: Timeless, root-level)
*   **Spanish:** (Style: Vibrant, active)
*   **Japanese:** (Style: Minimal, precise - provide Romaji)
*   **Greek:** (Style: Mathematical, logical)
*   **Wildcard:** Choose one other language (e.g., German, Esperanto, Swahili) that best fits the specific "vibe" of this project.

### 3. The Abstract Brand (3 Options)
Short, punchy, 4-6 letter words that are unique/invented and easy to type in a CLI (e.g., *Zele, Goke*).

### 4. The Tech Modifier (3 Options)
Use standard dev prefixes/suffixes (un-, -map, -flow, -ix, -sys, -ify) to create a utilitarian description (e.g., *Unframer, Agentmap*).

***

**Analyze the current repository (read key files like README.md, package.json, Cargo.toml, or source code) to understand the project's functionality, target audience, and technical "vibe", then generate names.**
