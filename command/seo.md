# seo optimizer

use this command to automate seo workflows for blog posts and newsletters.

## workflow

1. **content fetch**: read full text from provided URL or block.
2. **slug optimization**: recommend short, keyword-rich URL slugs.
3. **keyword research**: identify 9 high-intent keywords using web search.
4. **internal linking**: suggest links based on content length.
5. **alt text**: generate descriptive alt text for images.
6. **headings**: audit and fix h1-h6 hierarchy.
7. **meta tags**: write compelling meta titles and descriptions.

## core principles

- **voice preservation**: never destroy author's tone for keywords.
- **no stuffing**: focus on relevance, not density.
- **hierarchy**: one h1, sequential h2-h6.

## implementation

when triggered, execute all steps in sequence. provide final report on changes and improvements.
