# Deep Research Command

Invoke the deep-research skill which implements a Lutum Veritas-inspired pipeline:

## Quick Verify Mode (6 Stages)
For factual questions needing verification:
1. Intent Analysis - Understand what user needs
2. Knowledge Gap - Determine what must be searched
3. Search Strategy - Create targeted search plan
4. Answer Synthesis - Generate answer with citations
5. Claim Audit - Self-verify every claim
6. Verification - Cross-check against additional sources

## Deep Research Mode
For comprehensive analysis:
1. Clarification - Ask smart follow-up questions
2. Research Plan - Generate investigation points
3. Deep Research - Execute per point with context passing
4. Final Synthesis - Cross-reference all findings

## Usage

```
/deep-research Is AI coding actually faster?
/deep-research Compare React vs Vue in 2025
/deep-research What are the true costs of AI assistants in enterprise?
```

**The skill will:**
- Determine which mode is appropriate
- Ask clarifying questions if needed
- Execute the verification pipeline
- Present findings with source transparency
- Flag areas of uncertainty honestly

This approach emphasizes verification over confidence - every claim is audited, contradictions are sought, and uncertainty is explicitly acknowledged.
